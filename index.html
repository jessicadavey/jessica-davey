      Originally from Batavia, Illinois, Jessica Davey moved to England in 2006
      to study jazz and music composition at the Liverpool Institute for
      Performing Arts (founded by former Beatle Paul McCartney). After
      graduating with 1st class honours in 2009, she performed both alone and
      with bands throughout England for several years. In January 2015, Jessica
      began performing as a solo piano vocalist for P&O Cruises Australia,
      completing 3 4-month contracts over the course of 18 months. She relocated
      to Scotland in the summer of 2016 and quickly became a regular artist at
      the many piano bars in Glasgow City Centre. In April 2017, she travelled
      to Japan as the resident piano vocalist for The Ritz Carlton, Osaka, and
      in 2018 completed a 4-month contract on the cruise ship Marella Discovery
      2. She now lives in the countryside near Nashville, Tennessee.
